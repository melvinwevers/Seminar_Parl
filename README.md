## Mining Historical Parliamentary Debates

Date: March 24, 2020
Time: 13:00 - 18:30

### Summary
Projects such as PoliticalMashup and DiLiPaD have created repositories of digitized historical parliamentary records. In early 2019, the ParlaFormat workshop presented different digitized and annotated corpora of parliamentary data. These resources enable scholars to apply computational methods to study topics and the structure of discourse in such debates. This workshop presents an overview of recent efforts in the field of digital history that studied parliamentary records from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. This workshop focuses on methods to analyze the data in order to answer historical questions.

### Timetable

13:00-14:00: Keynote - Jo Guldi - "A Distant Reading of Property: Finding Evidence of a Revolution Around Rights to Occupation in the Debates of Britain's Parliament, 1806-1911"

Conservative accounts of the history of property law describe a set of principles unchanged since Locke, much like Newton's discovery of gravity.  What happens when we use computational techniques to detect continuity and discontinuity in the language of property over the timescale of a century?  This talk presents evidence that something like a revolution in property in fact occurred in Britain's discussion of property law, eviction, rent control, and empire around 1881-6, based on multiple, quantitative approaches to the longue-duree history of legal discourse.  

_Biography_
Jo Guldi is an Associate Professor of the History of Britain and its Empire at Southern Methodist University.  She is also PI of a $1 million NSF grant called "The Unaffordable World."  She founded and directs Think-Play-Hack, an interdisciplinary summer school and hackathon.   She also directs Democracy Lab, a multi-university initiative to create a transparent infrastructure for text mining the transcripts of democratic debate.   She is author of Roads to Power (Harvard 2011) and co-author, with David Armitage, of The History Manifesto (Cambridge 2014).  She has recently published several articles relating to best methods for applying critical theory to quantitative text-mining, as well as more traditional articles on the history of rent and eviction in western cities.

14:00- 14:30: Ida Nijenhuis & Marijn Koolen (HUYGENS / ING) - REPUBLIC

14:30 - 15:00: Milan van Lange (NIOD) - Sentiment Analysis of Dutch Parliamentary Debates
Milan van Lange studied History at the Radboud Universiteit in Nijmegen. Since 2016 he works as a PhD-candidate at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam and Utrecht University. From February till May 2019 Milan worked as a PhD Research Fellow at The Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH) located in Belval, Luxembourg.
 
In his current PhD-project ‘War & Emotions’ he investigates developments in attitudes and emotions in Dutch parliamentary debates. Milan is especially interested in the post-war dealing with the (consequences of) the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. His research includes (changing) meanings of justice, and the role of emotions in how parliamentarians dealt with/discussed war crimes and criminals, collaboration, victimhood, the resistance, etc.
 
In his research he uses digitised historical text corpora and text mining to identify, describe, and analyse emotions in historical sources. During the seminar Milan will present some preliminary results of his PhD-project. He would like to discuss visualisation techniques for text mining output, and hopes to reflect on the integration of text mining output, visualisations and statistics in historical publications/narratives.

Have Women Changed the Political Debate? Studying the Substantive Representation of Women in Postwar Britain

After Tony Blair's landslide victory in 1997, 120 female MPs were returned. Overnight the number of women MPs doubled. To what extent, however, has the increasing presence of women in Parliament made more than a symbolic difference? In Westminster, and across the world, the question of whether female legislators have
changed the substance of debate has generated enormous interest amongst political scientists and, to a lesser extent, among contemporary historians. In this presentation, we analyse whether the growing presence of women has changed the agenda of Westminster, and made it more receptive to the priorities of women MPs (as they have been articulated over time). We tackle this question as follows: First, we determine what issues women MPs have focused on—measured by calculating what policy issues they have engaged with.  Secondly, we measure the difference women legislators made by quantifying motions they moved and the debate they thus generated. Lastly, we attempt to quantify how influential women’s voices were over the last sixty years, by computing if their contributions resonated in the debates in which they participated.
